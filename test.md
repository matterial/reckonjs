## The Editor You Will Fall In Love With

In its own words, Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.

## The Gist

Sublime Text is a cross platform editor that is built close to the metal (C++) with a minimalist UI, fast performance and great memory management that supports marvellous features via its Plugins API (Python). With visually appealing themes, JSON-based settings, great syntax highlighting and wide support for code bundles and build routines, Sublime Text is a winner for anyone related to code.

I have been a keyboard worshipper and a mouse atheist (If that makes any sense) and Sublime Text allows for open configuration of keyboard shortcuts and key bindings - the power of which any *Vim* enthusiast will be able to relate with.

Given an opportunity to talk about Sublime Text, here is a quick presentation I've compiled that highlights some of it's important features for those who are new to Sublime Text: <a href="http://riten.io/sublime/" target="_blank">**Presentation**</a>

## New to Sublime Text? Some basic steps below can help.

### 2. Download Sublime Text

Sublime Text can be downloaded for free and evaluated without any restrictions for as long as needed. There are no time or feature restrictions, except that it keeps reminding you that it is an evaluation version after *n* number of *saves*. 

You can download it now <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" title="Download Sublime Text" target="_blank">from here</a>.

### 3. Install Package Control

You can download Sublime Text plugins directly from their plugins page and manually add it to the plugins directory, but we'll skip that part. 

Let us download one plugin, that allows us to download all other plugins from within Sublime Text. **Crafty.**

<a href = "https://sublime.wbond.net/installation" target="_blank">Head here to Install the PackageControl plugin with a one-line command into the console.</a> Then come back for next steps.

### 4. Add useful Plugins

On a Mac, hitting ⌘ + ⇧ + P will fire up the command pallette. Type "install" to filter out this pallette and choose the option that says **Package Control: Install Package** and hit Enter. 

At this point you will see a loading indication in your status bar at the bottom (it could take a while for the first time).

The next pallette that fires up automatically after a short while is the plugins searcher. Type the name of the plugin you need and it will install it. Below are the list of some great plugins:

1. **Emmet** (Generate HTML from writing CSS selectors in HTML files)
2. **DocBlockr** (Create code documentations easily)
3. **GitGutter** (See Git Diffs in the editor's gutter)
4. **RESTer** (A REST client within Sublime Text)
5. **Afterglow** (A great visual theme)
